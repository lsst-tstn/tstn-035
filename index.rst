Abstract
========

This tech-note explores how the Rubin Observatory Control System can handle Targets of Opportunity (ToO). It is outside the scope of this document the selection criteria, e.g. which ToOs will be executed.  Here we will focus on the operational aspects; from receiving and curating requests to actually executing the observations.
